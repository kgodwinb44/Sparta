# Statistical Concepts

This guide will provide information regarding some fundemental statisitcal concepts

 ## Averages 

 **'Averages'** a number expressing the central or typical value in a set of data.

 There are 3 types of averages:

 - **Mean**
 The Mean is the most commonly used average. 
 To calculate the mean you must:

 1. Add the values together (Sum)
 2. Divide the (Sum) by the number of values


 - **Median**
 If you place a set of numbers in order, the **Median** is the one in the middle.
 To calculate the mean you must:

 1. Place the numbers in numerical order (Lowest to Highest)
 2. If the number observation is odd, the median is the middle value
- **However if the observation is even**
 3. Find the **Mean** of the two middle values


 - **Mode**
 The Mode is the most common value that appears.
 To find the mode you must:

 1. Count the occurence of each number
 2. The number with the highest occurence is the **Mode**

 ## Standard Deviation

**Standard Deviation** measures how spread out the values in a dataset are from the mean.

- A **low standard deviation** means the values are close to the mean.  
- A **high standard deviation** means the values are spread out over a wider range.

It helps to understand the variability or consistency within the data.

## Distributions

A **distribution** shows how data points are spread or arranged.

- It tells us the frequency of each value or range of values in a dataset.
- Distributions are often visualized using graphs like **histograms** or **density plots**.

---

## Normal Distribution

The **Normal Distribution** is a common, symmetric, bell-shaped distribution.

- Most data points cluster around the mean.  
- The mean, median, and mode are all equal in a perfect normal distribution.  
- Many natural phenomena, like heights or test scores, follow a normal distribution.

## Positive Skew

A **Positive Skew** (or right-skew) means the tail of the distribution stretches to the right.

- Most data points are concentrated on the left.  
- The mean is typically greater than the median.

**Example:** Income distribution where a few people earn very high salaries.

---

## Negative Skew

A **Negative Skew** (or left-skew) means the tail of the distribution stretches to the left.

- Most data points are concentrated on the right.  
- The mean is typically less than the median.

**Example:** Test scores where most students score high but a few score very low.

---

## Outliers

**Outliers** are data points that are significantly different from others.

- They can affect averages and spread measurements.  
- Outliers may indicate errors or important unique events.

**Example:** In the dataset [10, 12, 11, 14, 90], the number 90 is an outlier.

---

## Correlations

**Correlation** measures the relationship between two variables.

- Values range from **-1 to 1**:  
  - **+1** indicates a perfect positive correlation (both increase together).  
  - **-1** indicates a perfect negative correlation (one increases while the other decreases).  
  - **0** means no correlation.

**Note:** Correlation does **not** imply causation.

**Example:** Height and weight usually have a positive correlation.
